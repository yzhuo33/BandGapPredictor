##  Prerequisites

This package requires:

- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
- [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html)
- [xlrd](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Usage

### Define a customized prediction set

You should create a `.xlsx` file named `to_predict.xlsx`, in which the compositions that are of interest are listed in the first column with the header "`Composition`". There is an example of the `to_predict.xlsx` file in the repository.

### Predict bandgap energy

After preparing `to_predict.xlsx`, you can get the Eg prediction by:

```bash
python Eg_model.py
```

`Eg_model.py` will automatically read `elements.xlsx` and `Training_Set.xlsx` to generate a prediction. A classifier will first categorize a composition into metals (Eg = 0) or nonmetals (Eg > 0), then the Eg of nonmetals will be predicted with a regressor. After running, you will get a `.xlsx` file named `predicted.xlsx` in the same directory, in which the predicted Eg is provided next to the corresponding composition.
